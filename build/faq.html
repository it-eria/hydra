                  Coconut water is the clear, fat-free liquid that’s inside a young coconut when you crack it open! It’s naturally rich electrolytes, especially potassium. It’s low in calories, cholesterol-free, and tastes great!

                  Yes! After coconuts are harvested, washed, and cracked open, the liquid inside is flash-pasteurized and then packaged in a Tetra Pak. Flash pasteurization helps preserve the best natural flavor and nutrients, kill potentially harmful bacteria, and make Vita Coco coconut water shelf-stable for up to 12 months.

                <p>
                  Yes, a little bit—hear us out! Here’s why: coconuts can vary in taste, so we add less than 1% natural fruit sugar to our non-flavored coconut water. That helps to standardize the taste and sweetness levels regardless of harvest, time of year, or country of origin.

                  Coconut water is the clear, nutritious liquid that comes from inside young coconuts. Vita Coco Coconutmilk is made by combining Vita Coco’s coconut water with coconut cream (from the meat of mature coconuts) and water.

                <p>
                  Some brands “refine” their coconut oil, meaning that they chemically process and bleach dried coconut meat before extracting the oil. We don’t. Vita Coco is cold-pressed and chemical free, which makes it “unrefined.”
