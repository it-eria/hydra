            "inner-title": "Is it safe to drink Vita Coco while pregnant?",
            "inner-body": "Yes! Pregnant women can drink our coconut water, because it’s flash pasteurized (learn more about flash pasteurization in the OUR PRODUCTS section). If you have an allergy or health condition, check with a physician before consuming Vita Coco just to be safe!"
          },
          {
            "inner-title": "What is coconut water?",
            "inner-body": "Coconut water is the clear, fat-free liquid that’s inside a young coconut when you crack it open! It’s naturally rich electrolytes, especially potassium. It’s low in calories, cholesterol-free, and tastes great!"

            "inner-title": "Are Vita Coco beverages pasteurized?",
            "inner-body": "Yes! After coconuts are harvested, washed, and cracked open, the liquid inside is flash-pasteurized and then packaged in a Tetra Pak. Flash pasteurization helps preserve the best natural flavor and nutrients, kill potentially harmful bacteria, and make Vita Coco coconut water shelf-stable for up to 12 months."

            "inner-title": "How do you read the best-by date?",
            "inner-body": "Not the way you think—the best-by date, found at the top of every Tetra Pak, is dated 12 months from the production date, and is read as such: day/month/year."

            "inner-title": "Does Vita Coco add sugar to its coconut water?",
            "inner-body": "Yes, a little bit—hear us out! Here’s why: coconuts can vary in taste, so we add less than 1% natural fruit sugar to our non-flavored coconut water. That helps to standardize the taste and sweetness levels regardless of harvest, time of year, or country of origin."
          },
          {
            "inner-title": "What does “never from concentrate” mean?",
            "inner-body": "Some other brands use coconut water from concentrate—meaning, reconstituted with water and additives before packaging—but, never Vita Coco. We’re committed to using only the freshest coconut water possible, giving us the right to say we’re never from concentrate!"
